// User inputs size of the board (2D Array) they would like to use. The user procedes to enter to contents of the board and the number
// of times the simulation runs. The board changes according to the rules.

// Rules
// 1. If a cell is occupied but has no more than one occupied neighbor, then it is empty in the next generation.
// 2. If a cell is occupied and has four or more occupied neighbors, then it is empty in the next generation.
// 3. An occupied cell with either two or three occupied neighbors remains occupied in the next generation.
// 4. An empty cell is occupied in the next generation if it has exactly three occupied neighbors.
// 5. All changes in occupancy take place at the same time, so a cell that will become empty may influence another cell to become occupied.
